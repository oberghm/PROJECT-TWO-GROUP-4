        <h2>The first critique from our client:</h2>
        <p>When speaking with our client she was very happy and suprised with the end result.
            She loves the overall layout, color scheme and styles.
            As we continue to work on the backend and implement more java script into the website,
            she would like to have some photo slide shows and a page for partnerships.</p>
        <h2>Her review now:</h2>
        <p>She is very pleased with the layout and design on the website, she likes the modern feel.
            Molly is happy that we added a page for partnerships and added a photo slide show on the home page.
            As we pass on the website to her, Hallie will be working to add an API that holds all images.
            Molly is pleased with the website as a whole and has all the requirements she was looking for. 
        </p>

    <h2>Additional comments</h2>
    
        <p>Hallie spoke with you about the background images not working on the local host, if you would like to see these open it using live server. If any other styling issues occur please contact Hallie Oberg. The styling works better in live server on mac than it does on local host. However, everything should be working fine other than the background images.</p>
